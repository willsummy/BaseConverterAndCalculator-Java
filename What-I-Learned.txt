Lessons:

-Integers and doubles both have inherent accuracy flaws.
	This can be normally fixed with Big Decimal, but
	can be more difficult with dynamically changing
	accuracy requirements
-Converting values into other bases can present unique challenges.
	Some numbers that terminate naturally in decimal notation,
	may have infinite repeating values in other notations.
	Similar to 1/3 being 0.3333... repeating.
-Some application can run in different paradigms and function equally
	well in both. This particular application was also written in
	Python with the same functionality, but same detriments.
