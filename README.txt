General Information:
This converter has some inherent accuracy flaws. Due to ints and doubles
having troubles at large lengths, the integer conversion is capped at 16
digits. The fractional conversion is similar, but has decent value accuracy
up to around 20 digits. This will be refined as well as it can be in later
forms but cannot be overcome entirely, simply due to the nature of covnerting
bases. Thanks for taking a peak!
