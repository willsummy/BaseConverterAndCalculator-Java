Hello! Thanks for looking at my converter. I made this after a class homework
asked us to convert a decimal value to binary. It grew until I wanted to convert
base 2-36 to any other base in the same range. Maybe eventually I'll try to tackle
some weirder math. 

Unfortunately this converter has some inherent accuracy flaws. Due to ints and doubles
having troubles at large lengths, the integer conversion is capped at 16
decimal value digits. The fractional conversion is similar, but has decent value accuracy
up to around 20 digits. This will be refined as well as it can be in later
forms but cannot be overcome entirely, simply due to the nature of covnerting
bases. Thanks for taking a peak!
